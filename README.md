# Energy Monitor

Collects whole-house energy data into one TimescaleDB (Postgres): solar generation read from a
Sungrow inverter over Modbus TCP, and electricity/gas consumption taken from DSMR-reader's MQTT
export. Publishes solar values to MQTT, and optionally uploads to PVOutput (every few minutes) and
Mindergas (once daily). Built as a self-maintained replacement for the third-party
`bohdans/sungather` image.

## Features

- Polls the inverter every `SCAN_INTERVAL` seconds over Modbus TCP (function code 4 / input
  registers): generation power, daily and lifetime yield, DC/MPPT voltage & current, phase voltage,
  internal temperature.
- Subscribes to DSMR-reader's JSON MQTT topics for smart-meter electricity and gas readings, and
  writes those to the same database too — so one place holds generation *and* consumption.
- Writes every reading to TimescaleDB (`solar` table, `source=sungrow`; smart-meter data under
  `electricity` / `gas_positions` / `electricity_day_totals` with `source=dsmr`). Fields not in a
  table's fixed columns land in an `extra` JSONB column instead of failing the write, so enabling
  a new DSMR/plug field needs no code change here — see [Smart plugs](#smart-plugs-zigbee2mqtt)
  for what that keeps schemaless.
- Publishes the same values to MQTT, one topic per field under `MQTT_TOPIC_PREFIX`.
- Optionally pushes a status update to PVOutput on an interval (gated by `ENABLE_PVOUTPUT`,
  default off).
- Optionally pushes the previous day's cumulative gas meter reading to Mindergas shortly after
  midnight (gated by `ENABLE_MINDERGAS`, default off), reading the value back out of the
  `gas_positions` table this container itself writes.

Both external-upload flags default to `false` in the image, so this can run safely alongside an
existing uploader (e.g. `sungrow_monitor`/DSMR-reader) without double-reporting until each cutover
happens. They are cut over independently; a deployment may enable **both**: Mindergas
(`ENABLE_MINDERGAS=true`, once DSMR-reader's own Mindergas export was confirmed disabled) and, as
of 2026-08-02, PVOutput (`ENABLE_PVOUTPUT=true`, once `sungrow_monitor`'s own `pvoutput` export was
disabled in its `config.yaml`).

Note when taking PVOutput over from another uploader mid-day: with `PVOUTPUT_CUMULATIVE_FLAG=2`,
PVOutput derives the day total from deltas between successive `v1` values, so the handoff itself
looks like a meter reset and it re-anchors the running day total to 0 at that point. Cutover-day
totals are therefore under-reported; it self-corrects at the next midnight reset. Cut over at night
if that matters.

## Log levels

`LOG_LEVEL` sets the minimum severity written to stdout; everything below it is silent. The
default, `WARNING`, is the minimal-logging setting for normal operation:

| Level | Shows | When to use it |
|---|---|---|
| `WARNING` (default) | Config problems, connection loss/refusal, a full write queue, a stale poll skipping an upload, and every caught exception (always logged at error severity with a traceback, regardless of this setting) | Normal operation. Silences the 5-second poll heartbeat and routine push confirmations, so healthy running produces no output at all. |
| `INFO` | The above, plus the recurring poll heartbeat (`Poll ok: ac=...`), startup/connection confirmations, and successful PVOutput/Mindergas pushes | Confirming the container is alive and doing what's expected, without full per-field detail. |
| `DEBUG` | The above, plus per-field detail such as a DSMR value that failed to parse and was dropped | Diagnosing a specific data problem, e.g. a smart-meter field arriving as something unexpected. |
| `ERROR` | Only config problems and caught exceptions | Quieter than the default; loses the connection-state warnings (MQTT disconnects, a full write queue), which are usually the useful signal before something breaks outright. |
| `CRITICAL` | Practically nothing — this file has no `log.critical` calls | Not useful here; included only because it's one of Python's standard levels. |

An unrecognised value (e.g. a typo) does not stop the container: it falls back to `WARNING` and
prints one line to stderr naming the invalid value and the valid options.

Change it with a redeploy (`docker compose up -d energy-monitor` after editing the compose file's
`LOG_LEVEL`) — there's no way to change it on a running container without restarting it.

## Modbus register map

Targets the **Sungrow SG5.0RS** (`device_type_code` `0x2606`, nominal 5.0 kW) — a single-phase
residential string inverter, so the hybrid-only (SH-series) register blocks don't apply. Register
addresses, datatypes and scaling are Sungrow's own published Modbus protocol definition as encoded
in [bohdan-s/SungrowClient](https://github.com/bohdan-s/SungrowClient) — referenced for
interoperability, not vendored code. See `REGISTERS` in `app.py` for the exact addresses.

Addresses there are 1-based protocol register numbers; Modbus reads are 0-based, hence the `-1`
in `poll_inverter`. All registers are read in a single input-register (function code 4) request.

`run_state` is decoded from the real `work_state_1` register (address 5038, outside the main block
but still within one Modbus read) via `WORK_STATES` in `app.py` — `Run`, `Stop`, `Standby`, `Fault`,
etc. An earlier assumption that this inverter family exposed no run/system-state register (that
block being hybrid-only in Sungrow's protocol) turned out to be wrong; it was derived from
`total_active_power > 0` instead until this was corrected. An unmapped code is logged as
`Unknown (0x....)` rather than silently dropped, so a new one shows up rather than going missing.

Values were validated against the real inverter: MPPT1 + MPPT2 DC power sums to `total_dc_power`,
and `total_active_power` (AC) sits just below it with a realistic conversion loss.

## Smart-meter data

Electricity and gas come from **DSMR-reader's own MQTT export**, not from its database, REST API or
InfluxDB export. Enable the JSON exports in DSMR-reader's admin UI (Configuration → MQTT) pointing
at the same broker this container uses, and set the topics here to match:

| Source key | Variable | DSMR-reader export | Written to table |
|---|---|---|---|
| `elec` | `DSMR_TOPIC_ELEC` | JSON telegram | `DSMR_ELEC_TABLE` (`electricity`) |
| `gas` | `DSMR_TOPIC_GAS` | JSON gas consumption | `DSMR_GAS_TABLE` (`gas_positions`) |
| `day` | `DSMR_TOPIC_DAY` | JSON day totals | `DSMR_DAY_TABLE` (`electricity_day_totals`) |

Each message is parsed, coerced to numbers (DSMR-reader publishes every value as a JSON string),
cached in memory for the PVOutput metrics, and written to Postgres. Non-numeric fields are skipped
rather than written as strings. Subscriptions are re-established on every reconnect, so a broker
restart doesn't silently leave the container deaf.

Why MQTT and not the alternatives:

- **DSMR-reader's InfluxDB export cannot work against InfluxDB 3.** Its client calls
  `find_bucket_by_name()` before writing, and InfluxDB 3 has no `/api/v2/buckets` endpoint — it
  returns 404, so the export fails before the (otherwise working) write is attempted.
- **Reading the P1 meter directly is not possible** when a ser2net-style bridge already feeds
  DSMR-reader: those endpoints accept a single client and answer `Port already in use`.
- The database and REST API would both work, but MQTT needs no schema coupling, no extra
  credentials, and no network changes — the broker connection already exists for publishing.

## Why power_flow updates from two triggers

`power_flow` (solar/grid/house at one instant) was originally only written from the inverter poll
loop, using whatever DSMR reading happened to be cached at that moment. That silently broke every
night: this inverter goes fully offline overnight (Modbus stops responding entirely, not just
idling at 0 W), so the poll loop's every attempt raised and nothing got written — not even a "0 W
solar" point — for as long as the inverter was asleep. The smart meter, meanwhile, keeps reporting
all night, so `electricity`'s own data never had a gap; only the derived `power_flow` table did,
and a Grafana chart spanning that gap just drew a straight line across it, which reads as a stuck
reading rather than a legitimate outage — the actual symptom that first surfaced this.

Fixed by writing `power_flow` from **either** side updating: the existing poll-loop trigger for
when the inverter is responding, plus a second trigger from every fresh DSMR `elec` message
(`_handle_dsmr_message` in `app.py`), each using the other side's latest cached value. On the DSMR
side, the inverter's contribution comes from `_solar_power_for_derived()`: the last poll's value if
it's within `SOLAR_STALE_AFTER`, otherwise `0.0` — deliberately zeroed rather than omitted, since a
stale solar poll here reliably means "asleep, not producing", unlike a DSMR outage (genuinely
unknown, so `derived_fields()` still omits grid/house rather than guessing). During the day, when
both sides are updating every few seconds, this doubles `power_flow`'s write rate — harmless at
TimescaleDB's scale, and still just one row per instant either trigger fires.

## Smart plugs (Zigbee2MQTT)

Optionally submeters individual circuits from metering Zigbee smart plugs published by
Zigbee2MQTT onto the same broker DSMR uses. Enable with `ENABLE_PLUGS=true` and list the topics
to subscribe to in `PLUG_TOPICS` as `topic=label` pairs; each label becomes the `source` column
value in `PLUG_TABLE` (default `smart_plugs`).

Unlike DSMR there is no fixed schema to map: different plug models publish different extra
fields (e.g. an Aqara plug's `device_temperature`/`power_outage_count` vs. a Tuya plug's
`indicator_mode`). Rather than hand-mapping each model, only the fields common to metering plugs
in general are kept -- `power` (W), `energy` (kWh), `current` (A), `voltage` (V) and `state`
(`ON`/`OFF`) -- so swapping a plug for a different model or adding a new one needs only a
`PLUG_TOPICS` entry, no code change. A topic not listed in `PLUG_TOPICS` is ignored.

## PVOutput mapping

Each PVOutput parameter is assigned a **metric** by name via `PVOUTPUT_V1`…`PVOUTPUT_V6`. Metrics
are already expressed in the unit PVOutput expects, so there is no scaling or formula syntax to
get wrong. Leave a variable unset and that parameter simply isn't uploaded.

The defaults reproduce exactly what the previous SunGather setup sent:

```yaml
- PVOUTPUT_V1=daily_generation_wh    # Energy Generation  (Wh)
- PVOUTPUT_V2=generation_w           # Power Generation   (W)
- PVOUTPUT_V6=inverter_voltage_v     # Voltage            (V)
# V3 (Energy Consumption), V4 (Power Consumption) and V5 (Temperature) unset
```

### Available metrics

| Metric | Unit | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `daily_generation_wh` | Wh | inverter | Day total, resets at midnight |
| `total_generation_wh` | Wh | inverter | Lifetime counter |
| `generation_w` | W | inverter | Current AC output |
| `dc_power_w` | W | inverter | Combined MPPT DC input |
| `inverter_voltage_v` | V | inverter | Grid voltage as the inverter measures it |
| `inverter_temp_c` | °C | inverter | **Heatsink**, not ambient (~50 °C running) — mapping this to `v5` will skew PVOutput's insolation figures, which is why the old setup left it off |
| `grid_import_w` | W | meter (`elec`) | Currently drawn from the grid |
| `grid_export_w` | W | meter (`elec`) | Currently fed back |
| `grid_voltage_v` | V | meter (`elec`) | Voltage as the smart meter measures it |
| `total_import_wh` | Wh | meter (`elec`) | Lifetime, both tariffs summed |
| `total_export_wh` | Wh | meter (`elec`) | Lifetime, both tariffs summed |
| `daily_import_wh` | Wh | meter (`day`) | Today's import so far |
| `daily_export_wh` | Wh | meter (`day`) | Today's export so far |
| `house_power_w` | W | derived (`elec`) | `generation + import − export` — what the house actually uses |
| `total_house_energy_wh` | Wh | derived (`elec`) | Lifetime equivalent of the above |
| `daily_house_energy_wh` | Wh | derived (`day`) | Day-total equivalent of the above |

Metrics sourced from the **meter** read the cached MQTT payloads described in
[Smart-meter data](#smart-meter-data) — `elec` means `DSMR_TOPIC_ELEC`, `day` means
`DSMR_TOPIC_DAY`. No Postgres query is involved, so these stay usable even while Postgres writes
are failing.

If a required payload hasn't arrived, or is older than `DSMR_MAX_DATA_AGE`, the parameters needing
it are dropped and the upload still goes out with the inverter-only values. A stopped DSMR-reader
therefore degrades the upload rather than losing it or reporting figures from hours ago.

### Reporting consumption as well as generation

To have PVOutput show household consumption, not just generation:

```yaml
- PVOUTPUT_V1=total_generation_wh
- PVOUTPUT_V3=total_house_energy_wh
- PVOUTPUT_V4=house_power_w
- PVOUTPUT_CUMULATIVE_FLAG=1
```

Lifetime metrics are used for `v1`/`v3` here on purpose: lifetime counters never reset, so there's
no day-boundary or timezone ambiguity about which day a figure belongs to.

`PVOUTPUT_CUMULATIVE_FLAG` (PVOutput's `c1`) **must agree** with whether `v1`/`v3` are lifetime
counters — `1` = both lifetime, `2` = only `v1`, `3` = only `v3`, omitted = both are day totals. A
mismatch makes PVOutput derive the wrong energy figures, so the container checks the combination at
startup and logs a warning describing the fix. An unknown metric name is a hard error: it logs the
full list of valid names and exits rather than uploading something unintended.

## Mindergas integration

Modelled on DSMR-reader's own exporter
([src/dsmr_mindergas/services.py](https://github.com/dsmrreader/dsmr-reader/blob/v6/src/dsmr_mindergas/services.py)):
picks the last gas reading timestamped strictly before local midnight (i.e. the previous day's
final reading) and POSTs `{"date": <that day>, "reading": "<m3>"}` to
`https://www.mindergas.nl/api/meter_readings` with an `AUTH-TOKEN` header.

One deliberate difference: DSMR-reader constrains that lookup to a fixed window (the 3 hours before
midnight) and gives up if no reading landed in it. `get_last_gas_reading()` applies **no lower
bound** — Mindergas wants the day's actual final reading, so a gap in gas ingestion should make the
upload late-but-correct rather than skip the day entirely. The meter reports only every 5 minutes
and `delivered` is a monotonic counter, so the most recent reading before midnight is the right
answer however far back it turns out to be.

The upload fires at `MINDERGAS_HOUR:MINDERGAS_MINUTE` (default 00:05 local), inside the 00:05–01:00
window Mindergas asks uploaders to use so their server load stays spread out.

Unlike the PVOutput metrics this reads from **Postgres**, not the MQTT cache — it needs the value as
it stood before midnight, which requires timestamped history rather than the latest value. It reads
the gas data this container itself wrote (`MINDERGAS_GAS_TABLE` defaults to `DSMR_GAS_TABLE`), so
the two stay consistent automatically.

Timestamps are timezone-aware on purpose: Postgres stores `timestamptz` as UTC and interprets a
naive value as the session's local time, so passing naive local time here would be ambiguous.

## Tests

`smoke_test.py` starts an in-process Modbus server serving known register values, polls it through
`app.poll_inverter`, and asserts the decoded results — including that DC input covers AC output and
that the MPPT strings account for the DC total, which catches word-order and scaling regressions.

```bash
docker build -t energy-monitor:dev .
docker run --rm -v "$PWD/smoke_test.py:/app/smoke_test.py:ro" energy-monitor:dev python3 /app/smoke_test.py
```

Both workflows run it: `pr-validate.yml` on pull requests, and `build.yml` **before** pushing the
image, so a dependency bump that breaks decoding at runtime can never reach `:latest`. That matters
because building alone proves nothing here — pymodbus 3.14 removed the `slave=` keyword in favour of
`device_id=`, which built cleanly and failed on every poll. The app now resolves that argument name
from the function signature, and the test would catch the next such change.

Note that Dependabot auto-merges anything it doesn't classify as `semver-major`, and it only waits
for status checks that branch protection marks **required**. Without branch protection on `main`,
`pr-validate` will not block a merge — the pre-push check in `build.yml` is what actually protects
the published image.

## Docker Compose

See `docker-compose.yml` in this repo for a usage example. A typical deployment has this
container is one service alongside the TimescaleDB instance it writes to,
alongside the TimescaleDB and Grafana instances it feeds.
